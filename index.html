    "options": ["Higher frequency decreases resistance", "Higher frequency confines current to surface, increasing resistance", "Frequency has no effect", "Skin effect only occurs at DC"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "At high frequency, current crowds at the conductor’s surface, raising effective resistance."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why are balanced lines less susceptible to external interference?",
    "options": ["They use a shield", "They radiate energy", "Noise induces equal voltages that cancel in differential mode", "They have lower capacitance"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Interference affects both conductors equally; differential detection cancels the noise."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the main use of transmission lines in RF and microwave systems?",
    "options": ["To transmit DC power efficiently", "To carry high-frequency signals with controlled impedance", "To amplify weak signals", "To reduce capacitance"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Transmission lines are critical in RF/microwave for guiding signals while maintaining impedance control."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does increasing conductor spacing in a parallel line affect capacitance?",
    "options": ["Capacitance increases", "Capacitance decreases", "Capacitance becomes infinite", "No change"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Larger spacing reduces electric field strength between conductors, lowering capacitance."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is impedance mismatch compared to an echo?",
    "options": ["Because signals are amplified", "Because part of the signal is reflected back toward the source", "Because the line length increases", "Because attenuation doubles"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Just like an echo reflects sound, mismatched impedance reflects electrical energy back to the source."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the role of shunt capacitance in a transmission line?",
    "options": ["Represents leakage losses", "Models the electric field storage between conductors", "Amplifies the signal", "Cancels reflections"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Shunt capacitance models stored energy in the electric field across the dielectric."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why does characteristic impedance remain constant regardless of line length?",
    "options": ["Because it is based on wave ratio, not physical length", "Because it cancels reflections", "Because frequency is fixed", "Because voltage and current don’t change"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Z₀ depends on per-unit-length L and C (geometry and dielectric), independent of how long the line is."
  },
  {
    "question": "What makes transmission line theory fundamental to antenna systems?",
    "options": ["Because antennas work only at DC", "Because proper feeding requires impedance matching for efficient radiation", "Because antennas reduce reflections", "Because antennas cancel capacitance"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Transmission lines deliver power from source to antenna; matching ensures minimal loss and maximum radiation."
